# Bangla OCR Using ML and DL  

This project focuses on building an **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system to extract and recognize **Bangla text** from images. The system integrates **machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques to improve the accuracy of text recognition in real-world Bangla text images.  

## Key Features  
- **Bangla Text Recognition**: Developed an OCR system specifically for **Bangla text**, extracting text from images accurately.  
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applied **binarization** and **segmentation** techniques to prepare images for recognition.  
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Enhanced OCR performance by integrating **Tesseract** OCR with deep learning techniques.  
- **Real-World Accuracy**: Optimized the model to improve recognition accuracy on real-world Bangla text.  

## Technologies  
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for deep learning model design and training.  
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing (binarization, segmentation).  
- **Tesseract OCR** for text extraction.  

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: Improved Bangla text recognition accuracy for various types of images.  
- **Performance**: Achieved high efficiency in real-world applications.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of Bangla text images annotated with ground truth text.
